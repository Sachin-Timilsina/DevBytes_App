DevByteRepository - 

DevByteRepository app displays a list of DevByte videos. DevByte videos are
short videos made by the Google Android developer relations team to introduce
new developer features on Android. This app demonstrates the Repository pattern,
the recommended best practice for code separation and architecture. Using
repository pattern the data layer is abstracted from the rest of the app.
Repositories act as mediators between different data sources, such as persistent
models, web services, and caches and the rest of the app.
